					<h2>JOURNEY SO FAR</h2>
					<P class="content">
						My name is Shuaibu Muhammad, I started learning web development
						when i got admission into ibrahim badamasi babangida university lapai.
						I first got influenced by a dear friend of mine called Emmanuel asika who introduced me
						to the basic of web designing. At first it was hard to learn it because it wasn't
						how i imagined it could be, but thanks to my dedication adn also listening to
						others advise i am now able to call myself a full-stack JavaScript developer.
